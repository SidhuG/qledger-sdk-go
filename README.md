# qledger-sdk-go

**Note**: This is a fork of the [QLedger Go SDK](https://github.com/RealImage/qledger-sdk-go) for [moov.io](https://github.com/moov-io). There are no guarentees of API compatibility as we intend this for our internal use. We do intend to push useful changes upstream for the larger ecosystem around [QLedger](https://github.com/RealImage/QLedger).

### Configuration

The following environmental variables can be set to configure a `Ledger` instance:

- `LEDGER_AUTH_TOKEN`: Token used to authenticate with a QLedger instance. (Example: `long-complex-secret-token`)
- `LEDGER_ENDPOINT`: HTTP address for QLedger instance (Example: `http://127.0.0.1:7000/qledger/`)
